This is a simple code that simulates ransomware
clearly less effective where it encrypts the data in text files, even harmless
it only encrypts data from 10 different files.

In this code, XOR was used, which is a cipher where we can perform bit-by-bit operations, for example, see:
<p>A --- B</p>
<p>0 xor 1 = 1</p>
<p>1 xor 0 = 1</p>
<p>0 xor 0 = 0</p>
<p>0 xor 0 = 0</p>
<p>0 xor 0 = 0</p>
<p>0 xor 0 = 0</p>
<p>1 xor 1 = 0</p>
<p>0 xor 0 = 0</p>

Look how simple, if both bits are different from each other, that is, if the 1 bit of B is equal to the 1 bit of A, 0 will be returned, and if it is different, 1 will be returned
I apologize for this low quality code, if you want to change anything, feel free!
